# Introduction to Next.js

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is an open-source React front-end development web framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React-based web applications.

### Features

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Renders React components on the server which speeds up the loading times and is beneficial for SEO.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-renders pages at build time, making your website extremely fast.
- **File-Based Routing**: Next.js uses the file system for routing; pages are associated with a route based on their filename.
- **API Routes**: Build your API endpoints within Next.js, which allows you to write server-side code directly in your React application.

### Code Snippet: Basic Next.js Page

```jsx
// pages/index.js
import Head from 'next/head';
import Link from 'next/link';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Head>
        <title>Welcome to Next.js!</title>
      </Head>

      <main>
        <h1>Welcome to Next.js!</h1>
        <p>
          Get started by editing <code>pages/index.js</code>
        </p>
        <Link href="/about">
          <a>About Us</a>
        </Link>
      </main>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Getting Started

To get started with Next.js, you need Node.js installed on your machine. Create a new Next.js app using `create-next-app`, which sets up everything automatically for you.

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
# or
yarn create next-app
```

After the installation is complete, you can start the development server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Why use Next.js?

Next.js provides a modern framework with everything you need for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more.

### Enhancements Over React

- **Automatic Routing**: Any URL is mapped to the filesystem, to files put in the `pages` folder, and you don't need to configure any routes manually.
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic image optimization works with any image source and is enabled with the new `next/image` component.
- **Fast Refresh**: Fast Refresh is a Next.js feature that gives you instantaneous feedback on edits made to your React components.

### Conclusion

Next.js simplifies the process of building a React application by providing a standard way to server-render pages, manage routing, and optimize your application for performance.
