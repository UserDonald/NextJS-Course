# Key Features of Next.js

Next.js is designed to improve the development and user experience by providing a set of features that address common issues in modern web development.

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Server-Side Rendering is one of the core strengths of Next.js. It allows pages to be rendered on the server and delivered to the client as HTML. SSR is critical for SEO and improves load times.

### Benefits

- **SEO Friendly**: Search engines can crawl the site content more efficiently.
- **Performance Gains**: Users see the fully rendered page faster, which can improve the perception of your site's speed.
- **Code Sharing**: You can use the same React components on the server and client, simplifying development.

### Example: Using SSR in Next.js

```js
// This is a simple example of a page that uses getServerSideProps to fetch data server-side.

// pages/ssr-page.js
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data = await res.json();
  return { props: { data } };
}

function SSRPage({ data }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Data Fetched Server Side:</h1>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
    </div>
  );
}

export default SSRPage;
```

## Static Site Generation (SSG)

Static Site Generation is another key feature where pages are generated at build time. This results in highly performant sites as the HTML is generated in advance.

### Benefits

- **Fast Loading Times**: SSG serves pre-built markup and assets over a CDN.
- **Scalability**: Serving static pages can handle more traffic than server-rendered pages.
- **Reliability**: Pre-built pages mean the server has less real-time work to do.

### Example: Using SSG in Next.js

```js
// This is a simple example of a page that uses getStaticProps to fetch data at build time.

// pages/index.js
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/static-data');
  const staticData = await res.json();
  return { props: { staticData } };
}

function HomePage({ staticData }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to our Homepage</h1>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(staticData, null, 2)}</pre>
    </div>
  );
}

export default HomePage;
```

## File-Based Routing

Next.js uses the filesystem as the primary method for routing. This approach simplifies the process of adding new pages and routes.

### Benefits

- **Intuitive**: Just create a file in the `pages` directory and it automatically becomes a route.
- **Dynamic Routes**: Next.js supports dynamic routes using file and folder naming conventions.
- **Link Prefetching**: Automatic prefetching for faster page transitions.

### Example: File-Based Routing

```js
// The file system layout translates directly to the route structure.

// pages/index.js maps to the / route
// pages/about.js maps to the /about route
// pages/posts/[id].js maps to /posts/:id route (dynamic)
```

## API Routes

Next.js allows you to create API endpoints as a part of your Next.js application. These API routes can be used to handle form submissions, database operations, etc.

### Benefits

- **Integrated**: No need for a separate server or backend.
- **Extendable**: Easily connect with databases or external APIs.
- **Serverless**: Deployable as serverless functions for scale and ease of use.

### Example: API Route

```js
// pages/api/hello.js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello from Next.js!' });
}
```

## Conclusion

These key features of Next.js simplify the process of building complex applications by providing an easy-to-use convention over configuration approach. By mastering these features, developers can produce high-quality, scalable, and performant web applications with ease.
