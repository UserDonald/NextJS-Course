# Next.js Project Creation

Creating a new Next.js project is a straightforward process, thanks to the `create-next-app` utility which sets up everything you need to get started with Next.js. This section will guide you through the project creation process and the initial steps to customize your new Next.js application.

## Setting Up a New Next.js Project

The `create-next-app` command creates a new Next.js application with a default setup. You can run it using `npx`, which is included with `npm` version 5.2+ and higher.

### Step 1: Create a New Application

Run the following command in your terminal to create a new Next.js app:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
# or with yarn
yarn create next-app my-next-app
```

Replace `my-next-app` with your desired project name.

### Step 2: Start the Development Server

Navigate into your new project folder and start the development server:

```bash
cd my-next-app
npm run dev
# or with yarn
yarn dev
```

Your new Next.js application is now running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Exploring the Project Structure

After creating your project, you'll notice several directories and files have been created for you:

```
my-next-app/
  pages/
    _app.js
    index.js
  public/
  styles/
    Home.module.css
  package.json
  README.md
```

- `pages/`: Contains the page components that define your application's routes.
- `public/`: Used for static files like images, fonts, and other assets.
- `styles/`: Where CSS and stylesheets reside.
- `package.json`: Manages your project's scripts, dependencies, and more.

## Customizing Your Project

With the project setup, you can begin customizing your application:

### Adding Styles

Next.js supports CSS Modules out of the box. Edit `styles/Home.module.css` to change the styles for your homepage.

### Customizing `pages/index.js`

The `pages/index.js` file corresponds to the `/` route and is the first page users will see. You can edit this file to change the content of your homepage.

### Adding New Pages

Create new files in the `pages` directory to add more routes to your application. For example, creating `pages/about.js` will automatically create the `/about` route.

### Example: Adding a New Page

```jsx
// pages/about.js
export default function About() {
  return <div>About us</div>;
}
```

## Next Steps

- **Explore Layouts**: Consider creating a layout component to share common designs across different pages.
- **Learn Routing**: Familiarize yourself with Next.js's file-based routing and dynamic routes.
- **Understand Data Fetching**: Get to know Next.js's data fetching methods like `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps`.

## Conclusion

You've now set up a basic Next.js project and are ready to start building. As you continue with this cheat sheet, you'll learn how to expand upon this foundation, integrate advanced features, and optimize your application for production.
